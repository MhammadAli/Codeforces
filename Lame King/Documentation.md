# Purpose
The given code is written to solve a programming problem that takes input in the form of test cases, where each test case is defined by two integer values a and b. The program is expected to calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach from point (0,0) to point (a,b) on an infinite 2D grid. Each step can be either in the positive or negative direction along the x or y axis.
# Input
The program takes input from the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard. The input consists of the following:

  1. The first line contains an integer t(1≤t≤10^4), representing the number of test cases.
  2. Each of the next t lines contains two integers a and b (−100≤a,b≤100), representing the x and y coordinates of the destination point for that test case.

# Ouptut
The program outputs the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination point from (0,0) for each test case. The output is written to the standard output stream, which is usually the console. The output consists of t lines, where each line contains a single integer, representing the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination point for that test case.

# Functionality
The program calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination point from (0,0) for each test case. The algorithm to calculate the steps is based on the observation that for any point (a,b) on the grid, the minimum number of steps required to reach that point is equal to 2 * max(abs(a), abs(b)) - 1, except for the case when abs(a) = abs(b). In that case, the minimum number of steps required is 2 * abs(a).
The program implements this algorithm using a while loop that iterates t times, where t is the number of test cases. In each iteration, it reads two integer values a and b from the standard input stream. It then checks whether abs(a) = abs(b). If true, it calculates the minimum number of steps using the formula 2 * abs(a) and outputs the result to the standard output stream. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of steps using the formula 2 * max(abs(a), abs(b)) - 1 and outputs the result to the standard output stream.

# Complexity
The time complexity of this program is O(t), where t is the number of test cases. The space complexity is O(1), as the program only uses a constant amount of memory for each test case.
